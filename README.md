### Hi there 👋

👨🏽‍🔬 Seven years ago, I decided to study Chemical Engineering because I wanted to fight climate change.

🌱 This led me to working at a Clean Energy startup company after graduation. For 2 years, I was deeply involved in the product life cycle, from idea to tangible product. Part of the product design involved using Python to model a novel chemical reactor. While I was able to do use data analysis to review the results and optimize our process, I was frustrated that I couldn’t contribute more to the software development of the chemical model.

👨🏽‍💻 This led me to start learning how to code in my evenings after work. I found the same passion in designing and building websites had initially led me to becoming an engineer. I also found that the skills I developed in engineering, such as troubleshooting and being detail-oriented, helped me to build better software. 

🌍 My mission is to empower the planet and its people through building amazing products. Please connect with me if you have an opportunity in mind.
