# 📖 My Story 
### Where I Came From 🌱
I have worked for 2 years in fighting climate change at a Clean Energy startup. I was deeply involved in the product life cycle, from idea to tangible product. Part of the product design involved using Python to simulate and optimize a novel chemical reactor. While I was able to do use data analysis to review the results and optimize our process, I was frustrated that I didn't have the skills to contribute more to the software development in Python.

### Why I Love Coding 👨🏽‍💻
This led me to start learning how to code in my evenings after work. The same passion that drew me to Chemical Engineering, I also found in building websites.  Skills that I had developed from working at a startup, such as first principles thinking and troubleshooting, helped me to write code.
